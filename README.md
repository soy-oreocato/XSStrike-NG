# XSSStrike-NG

## Vision

**XSSStrike-NG** is a BurpSuite plugin that facilitates a quick and intense identification of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This plugin assists the pentester by automating certain tasks to provide a quick overview of XSS exploitability.

## Features

### Dom-XSS

- Static analysis in passive mode

### Reflected-XSS

- **EntryPoints Identification**: In active mode, it searches for potential injection points in HTTP requests.

- **Polyglot Payload generated by genetic algorithms (BETA!!!)**: In active mode the plugin generates and uses Polyglot Payloads using genetic algorithms.

- **Context Identification**: Identifies the context in which the injection was executed. The contexts identified so far are: 
	- HTML: `<div>XsStRIke</div>`
	- Attribute HTML: `<img src="XsStRIke" alt="XsStRIke">`
	- Event HTML: `<button onclick="alert('XsStRIke')">Click me</button>`
	- CSS: `<style>body {background-image: url('XsStRIke');}</style>`
	- JavaScript: `<script>var data = "XsStRIke";</script>`

## Requirements
